> :warning: When you recover your private key, please double check if you have the correct HD path. If you have wrong HD path, it will recover a different private key. **If both your mnemonic phrase and private key is lost, then you may not regain access to your funds**.

> :warning: Please save your mnemonic phrase in a safe place and **DO NOT share with ANYONE**. User is responsible for managing the mnemonic phrase. If your mnemonic phrase is lost, there is no way to get the funds back.

> :warning: **DO NOT share your Secret Recovery Phrase with anyone!** If someone has access to your secret phrase, they will have access to your wallet. Cosmostation support will NEVER ask you for your secret phrase or your private key.
